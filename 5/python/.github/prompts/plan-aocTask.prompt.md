## Plan: Count Fresh Ingredient IDs in Python

Solve the task of counting how many available ingredient IDs are fresh, based on inclusive and possibly overlapping ranges, using a test-driven approach in Python.

### Steps
1. Review [test_main.py](../5/python/test_main.py) for structure and entry points.
2. Analyze [4/python/test_main.py](../4/python/test_main.py) for reference implementation and test style.
3. Write an initial test in `test_main.py` using the sample input from the prompt.
4. Implement a function in `test_main.py` to parse ranges and IDs, and count fresh IDs.
5. Iterate: Add more tests for edge cases (overlapping ranges, single ID, etc.), refining the solution as needed.
6. Finally, use 5/input.txt to get the final answer.

### Further Considerations
1. Should the solution handle malformed input gracefully, or assume well-formed input?
2. Consider efficiency for large input files, but prioritize correctness and clarity first.
