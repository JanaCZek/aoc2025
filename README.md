### Day 1
- C# and NUnit

**Practice** 
- TDD, domain modelling and separation of concerns

### Day 2
- Typescript and Vitest
- Implement task from day 1 and then day 2

**Practice** 
- TDD and creating small, single purpose functions

**Lessons learned**
- If you get stuck, take smaller steps
- Vitest is probably the best testing framework out of any frameworks and out of any languages
- Needed to create a minimal `tsconfig.json` file to make `fs` module work
- Prepare test and file reading infrastructure before opening the task for the day to save time

### Day 3
- Rust and `cargo test`
- Implement task from day 2 and then day 3

**Practice** 
- TDD and learning Rust

**Lessons learned**
- Github Copilot is your friend when learning Rust syntax
- This task took much longer than needed, because initially I went with a brute force approach, later got moving when decided to step by characters

### Day 4
- Python and `pytest`
- Implement task from day 3 and then day 4

### Day 5
- C and custom simple test runner
- Implement task from day 4 and then day 5

### Day 6
- Language TBD, probably Python
- Implement task from day 6

**Practice** 
- Planning AI agent in VS Code

### Day 7
- Language TBD, probably Python
- Implement task from day 7

**Practice** 
- Write tests first, then let AI do the implementation
