# Task
123 328  51 64 
 45 64  387 23 
  6 98  215 314
*   +   *   +  
Each problem's numbers are arranged vertically; at the bottom of the problem is the symbol for the operation that needs to be performed. Problems are separated by a full column of only spaces. The left/right alignment of numbers within each problem can be ignored.

So, this worksheet contains four problems:

123 * 45 * 6 = 33210
328 + 64 + 98 = 490
51 * 387 * 215 = 4243455
64 + 23 + 314 = 401
To check their work, cephalopod students are given the grand total of adding together all of the answers to the individual problems. In this worksheet, the grand total is 33210 + 490 + 4243455 + 401 = 4277556.

Of course, the actual worksheet is much wider. You'll need to make sure to unroll it completely so that you can read the problems clearly.

# Question
Solve the problems on the math worksheet. What is the grand total found by adding together all of the answers to the individual problems?

# Plan
- Understand the problem the task is asking us to solve.
- Read the input.txt file and inspect the data format. Make sure the algorithm you plan can handle the input format.
- Create a Python program that provides answer to the question.
- As part of the plan, verbalize the steps needed to solve the problem. Be as detailed as possible.
- Organize the steps in a logical order.
- Don't add the Further Considerations section.
- Provide answer to the question.

# Details
- Add both tests and implementation into test_main.py
- Use the examples from task as test cases
- First verify the algorithm works for the examples
- Then run the algorithm on the input-small.txt sample to verify it works on that
- Then run the algorithm on the input data to get the final answer
- Run tests using pytest c:/Projects/playground/aoc2025/6/python-ai/test_main.py -s
